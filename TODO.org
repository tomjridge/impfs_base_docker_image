- think about how to make docker builds quicker eg use ocaml and opam
  from nix to avoid opam switch
  - we can generate the opam install of opam packages locally
  - ditto for the ocaml executable; we can just tar the whole .opam
    directory after impfs_base_docker_image
    - this is about 400M, which is quite hefty
