Notes

- opam package repo changes all the time; makes sense to pick a
  particular version of this to introduce some stability; but we need
  to keep reasonably upto date with master
- ocaml version: we typically pick a particular reasonably-recent
  version eg 4.04.x or 4.06.x; as such, this is stable
- opam packages for our libs: should be reasonably stable, but when
  opam package repo is refactored we may discover missing dependencies
  etc


Plan

- work from a local mirror of opam package repo, pinned to some
  particular commit (reasonably recent)
- specify deps for our packages clearly, with comments about why we
  depend on a particular package; deps should use opam package names,
  but be aware that these may differ from ocamlfind libs :(
